        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <img src="https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/11194898.jpg" alt="About Photo">
        <p>Ha Eun-Gyeol is the youngest son of a nuclear family, his elder brother and parents are deaf and mute. Eun-gyeol has passion and talent for music, which he develops further with a lonely old man who runs a guitar shop. Eun-gyeol secretly performs in street busking shows and becomes a part of a band.

While performing on a stage show, Eun-gyeol is caught by his father Yi-chan who is disappointed to hear he dreams of a career in music. In an outburst of anger, Eun-gyeol tells him he's not their family interpreter and can not live only to satisfy his expectations. He decides to quit music after the altercation and attempts to sell his guitar at a mysterious shop and gets transported back in time to 1995.

He meets Yi-chan as a highschool student and is astonished to see he does not have speech or hearing impediments. He befriends him, joins his band and makes it his mission to ensure he does not get into an accident that caused him to lose his hearing. Yi-chan is pursuing music to impress Choi Se-Kyung, a popular cello player. He stumbles across Yoon Chung-Ah, who is extremely reserved.

Choi Se-Kyung's behavior changes almost overnight, being more outgoing and bubbly with Yi-chan and his friends. Eun-gyeol learns his mom Chung-Ah is mistreated by her stepmother and is prohibited from learning sign language. He convinces her father to let him teach her sign language. Eun-gyeol later learns Se-Kyung is actually Eun-yoo (Se-Kyung's daughter) who also time travelled like him. Gradually, Eun-gyeol and Se-Kyung develop feelings for each other and so do Chung-Ah and Yi-Chan.

Eun-Gyeol thwarts multiple dangerous situations that risk Yi-chan's life. He also helps Chung-Ah's father bond with her better and expose the stepmother and her children for mistreating her. Despite all of Eun-Gyeol's efforts, Yi-chan gets severely wounded in a car accident while attempting to save Eun-Gyeol. He loses his hearing and is heartbroken but Eun-gyeol pursuades him to never give up.

Shortly after, Eun-Gyeol is transported back to his present life and is initially disappointed that he couldn't save his father. But, he learns that the school band had not grown apart. Chung-Ah's dad had helped them financially and best of all, Yi-chan still pursues music, overcoming his disability. He also meets and reunites with Eun-yoo.</p>
